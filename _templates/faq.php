                                    <p>Pre Engineered Building (PEB) solutions are building systems that are designed, engineered, and manufactured in a factory, and then transported to the construction site for assembly. These buildings are made of steel and can be customized to meet the specific requirements of the customer.</p>

                                    <p>prefabricated buildings are generally more customizable, as they can be made from a variety of materials and built to specific designs, while pre-engineered buildings are more standardized, with components being pre-designed and pre-fabricated to meet specific size and shape requirements. Pre-engineered buildings are often used for industrial, commercial, and agricultural applications, where speed of construction and cost-effectiveness are important factors.</p>
